# AI Text Generation Project

This project showcases the use of AI language models for text generation using OpenAI's GPT-3.5. It demonstrates how AI can be leveraged to generate coherent and relevant content based on specific topics and themes.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore the capabilities of AI language models in generating text content. It includes the following components:

- Data preprocessing: The input text is preprocessed by performing tasks such as tokenization, lemmatization, and removal of stopwords to prepare it for analysis and generation.
- Topic identification: The input text is analyzed to identify key topics and themes using natural language processing techniques.
- Content generation: Based on the identified topics, the AI language model generates new content by combining words associated with those topics to create coherent and relevant sentences or paragraphs.
- Text classification: If labeled data is available, the lemmatized text can be used to train a text classification model for tasks such as sentiment analysis, spam detection, or topic classification.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `[git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-text-generation.git](https://github.com/lorenzilarissa/natural-language-generation)`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the main script: `python main.py`

## Usage and Examples

Here are some examples of how to use this project:

1. Generate content: Provide a paragraph or text as input, and the AI language model will generate new content based on the identified topics.
2. Text classification: If you have labeled data, you can train a text classification model using the lemmatized text for tasks such as sentiment analysis, spam detection, or topic classification.
